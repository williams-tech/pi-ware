WebApp Maker make web apps (Duh). It is open source and made with Python and Bash.
This app can take any website and turn it into an app.
I highly recommend turning these few websites into webapps:
- krunker.io (FPS Game)
- play.fancade.com (Minigame Arcade)
- Your own website (if you have one)
Apart from that enjoy this app.
